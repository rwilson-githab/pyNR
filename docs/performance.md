# Performance

## How the kernels are built

- **One fused loop per physics operation.** `adm_rhs` computes the metric
  derivatives, the Christoffel symbols, the Ricci tensor and all 16
  right-hand sides point by point, in a single pass over memory.
- `@njit(parallel=True, fastmath=True, cache=True, error_model="numpy")`:
  threads over the outer `i` index, LLVM optimisations as in `-O3 -ffast-math`,
  and on-disk caching of the machine code.
- Direction-specialised stencils (`pynr.kernels.fd.dx, dxy, ...`). Numba
  then emits straight-line code with no branches on the direction index.
- The Ricci tensor needs only the two contractions of $\partial\Gamma$, not all
  162 components (see `pynr.kernels.adm`).
- Kreiss-Oliger dissipation loops with the contiguous index innermost, so it
  vectorises (SIMD).

## Measured on an Apple M3 Pro, 12 cores (6P+6E), 18 GB, macOS 27, Python 3.14, Numba 0.67, 12 threads

```{table} Measured kernel timings.
:name: tab-performance

| kernel | grid | time | per point |
|---|---|---|---|
| ADM RHS, 1 thread | $64^3$ | 131 ms | 670 ns |
| ADM RHS, 12 threads | $96^3$ | 78 ms | 107 ns (≈1.3 µs·thread) |
| KO dissipation, 16 vars, 12 threads | $96^3$ | 8.5 ms | 0.7 ns / var |
```

Reproduce with `python scripts/benchmark.py 96`.

A full RK4 step of problem 6 ($135^3$ points, ADM + dissipation + boundaries)
takes about 1 s on this machine: 576 steps in 593 s (the problem-set cost table, {numref}`tab-problem-cost`, lists all problems with their machine).

## Where the remaining factor lies

A hand-tuned C++ ADM kernel would be roughly 3–5× faster per core. The gap
comes from the per-point scratch arrays (`g`, `gu`, `dg`, ...): LLVM cannot
prove they don't alias one another, so it keeps them in memory instead of
registers, and it cannot vectorise across grid points. The planned fix, the
first item on the [roadmap](roadmap/index.md), is to process a whole row of `k` at a
time, with every tensor operation as a short, SIMD-friendly loop over `k`.
This is the layout that code generators such as Kranc/McLachlan emit.
